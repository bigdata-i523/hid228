\begin{abstract}
Data generated by aviation industry is being increased enormously. The data generated by all the components of aviation industry can be analysed for reducing the operational costs, predict customer behaviour, analyse customer satisfaction. These applications of big data in aviation industry makes it a prominent player. Hence, collecting this data, storing and processing them for desired results can help the aviation industry in boosting their profits and improve customer satisfaction.Various applications of Big data, their challenges and models are discussed here.

\section{Introduction}

Big Data has transformed the businesses were being conducted. Every sector is integrated with data and generating huge amounts of data every day. All the companies are following data driven approach to crunch their competition. With the advent of concepts like Internet of things, the generation of data is increasing by many folds. This brings scope for a new business which handles the storage and analysis of data. 

The solutions offered by Big Data in many industrial sections have revolutionised the respective businesses. In aviation industry, where data as big as 20tb is generated from an aircraft flying for an hour, Big Data can offer influential solutions in terms of dealing with the massive data. This data ,if is processed in an efficient way would increase the customer satisfaction at a reduced running and operational costs which in turn increases the profits. 

\section{Applications}

\subsection{Baggage Handling}

All the customer check-in their bag and have a doubt if their bags are being transported with them. There are several cases where customers raise some complaints about their bag being missed are bag transported to another destination. Traditional barcode system was used to handle this task. As the number of airline users increased, this solution was not profitable for customers and airline operators. However, this is being replaced by the new technology which uses radio frequencies to track real-time location of the bag. Bags which are checked in at the kiosk are assigned with a microchip. These chips will send the data related to the location of the bag frequently.  The data generated by these chips is processed and stored. The processed data is available to the customers through mobile application or a web interface.
\subsection{Flight Safety}

All the flights have many sensors which generates a lot of data related to flight status and incidents. According to, a Being 737 generates nearly 20tb of data for one hour and an average cross international plane travelling for 6 hours generates 240 tb of data.  Most of these data is related to safety and status of various equipment on the flights. A lot of this data should be filtered and mined to generate a meaningful and usable data. Southwest Airlines partnered with NASA for crunching this data and generating a meaningful data. NASA uses machine learning algorithms to mine this data. 


This collected data from the flight can be analysed to decide a desired value for variables like altitude, wind speed, thrust, weight of the aircraft are proposed to the pilot for increased fuel economy. This data can also be helpful in deciding the nature of services according to the nature of the location and fuel costs.

\subsection{Personalized promotion}

In the advent of smart devices, all the industries including airline industry have come closer to the customer. Variables which are considered as characteristics are studied from the customer data available through their interaction with customers. These details range from preferences to behaviour of the customer. This data is analysed to study the behaviour of the customer and improve his experience with the airline industry. 

\subsection{Pricing strategies}

Pricing is an important strategy to generate profits. It is quite often to see a price bump of the airfare during the payment or checkout process. This is because of increase in demand for the journey. This demand data is analysed in the servers and shown on the customers screen in less than minute. This calculations and analysis requires high computing power and efficient algorithms. 


\section{Data Sources}

\subsection{In-Flight Data}

QAR Data: Quick Access Recorder records the statistics of the flight like speed, height, speed, altitude, at any instance during flight. This data is stored in servers and processed 

ACARS Data: Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System is a online data transmission system which transmits data to ground through the aircraft’s satellite communication system. ACARS records values of different parameters during a event. An event is an action performed by the aircraft. The sensors mounted on the flights’ brakes, wings, doors, send data to the ground staff using ACARS. Aircraft connection sensors and equipment monitoring system also uses this ACARS to transmit the data to ground.

\subsection{Data from mobile and web applications}

Now-a-days all the customer interactions with airline industry is through web. All the web applications and mobile applications which are developed for interacting with customer are smart enough to store the variables which are used to study the customer behaviour.  This portion of data sources generates the data at increasing rates due to the evolution of customer’s interaction with internet. 

\subsection{Historical Data}

Data available from the previous analytics and recordings constitutes a major portion. These are generally excel sheets or other forms of data stored in servers or files.  These can be used for predictive analysis of the flight.

\subsection{Other Sources}

Other sources like weather sensors, internet, analysis from third party vendors which help airline industry in scheduling and predicting flight delays .
