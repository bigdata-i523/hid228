\begin{abstract}
Data generated by aviation industry is being increased enormously. The data generated by all the components of aviation industry can be analysed for reducing the operational costs, predict customer behaviour, analyse customer satisfaction. These applications of big data in aviation industry makes it a prominent player. Hence, collecting this data, storing and processing them for desired results can help the aviation industry in boosting their profits and improve customer satisfaction.Various applications of Big data, their challenges and models are discussed here.

\section{Applications}

\subsection{Baggage Handling}

All the customer check-in their bag and have a doubt if their bags are being transported with them. There are several cases where customers raise some complaints about their bag being missed are bag transported to another destination. Traditional barcode system was used to handle this task. As the number of airline users increased, this solution was not profitable for customers and airline operators. However, this is being replaced by the new technology which uses radio frequencies to track real-time location of the bag. Bags which are checked in at the kiosk are assigned with a microchip. These chips will send the data related to the location of the bag frequently.  The data generated by these chips is processed and stored. The processed data is available to the customers through mobile application or a web interface.
\subsection{Flight Safety}

All the flights have many sensors which generates a lot of data related to flight status and incidents. According to, a Being 737 generates nearly 20tb of data for one hour and an average cross international plane travelling for 6 hours generates 240 tb of data.  Most of these data is related to safety and status of various equipment on the flights. A lot of this data should be filtered and mined to generate a meaningful and usable data. Southwest Airlines partnered with NASA for crunching this data and generating a meaningful data. NASA uses machine learning algorithms to mine this data. 

\subsection{Personalized promotion}

In the advent of smart devices, all the industries including airline industry have come closer to the customer. Variables which are considered as characteristics are studied from the customer data available through their interaction with customers. These details range from preferences to behaviour of the customer. This data is analysed to study the behaviour of the customer and improve his experience with the airline industry. 

\subsection{Pricing strategies}

Pricing is an important strategy to generate profits. It is quite often to see a price bump of the airfare during the payment or checkout process. This is because of increase in demand for the journey. This demand data is analysed in the servers and shown on the customers screen in less than minute. This calculations and analysis requires high computing power and efficient algorithms.
