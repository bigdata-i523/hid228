        Now-a-days, the process of storing the power measurements have
        changed. Conventional meters are replaced by the smart meters.
        New distribution management systems like SCADA and AMI are
        implemented to monitor power distribution.  These smart meters
        record the readings and communicate the data to the server.
        However, these systems are designed to generate the readings
        very frequently i.e., 15 minutes to an hour.  Upon that, smart
        meters are being deployed at every possible location to
        improve the accuracy of the data.  This advancements in
        electric power distribution system results in enormous amounts
        of data which requires advance analytics to process, analyse
        and store data.  This paper discusses about the implementation
        of Big Data technologies, challenges of implementing Big Data
        in Electric Power Distribution Systems.

        Data generated by aviation industry is being increased enormously. 
        The data generated by all the components of aviation industry can be
        analysed for reducing the operational costs, predict customer behaviour,
        analyse customer satisfaction. These applications of big data in aviation 
        industry makes it a prominent player. Hence, collecting this data,
        storing and processing them for desired results can help the aviation
        industry in boosting their profits and improve customer satisfaction.
        Various applications of Big data, their challenges and models are discussed here.

        Cricket is one of the most admired sports across the globe. Indian Premier League is
        one of the professional cricket leagues conducted by Board of Cricket Control India in 
        the months of April and May. This league is famous for its diversity of players and
        breath-taking cricket match endings. The factors of winning change for each moment 
        as the game progresses. As there are many players and franchises involved in the game,
        these factors for winning changes for each team. Data related to each player is required
        to analyse his performance and predict his future scope in team. Data related to factors of
        winning is crucial and can be analysed for predicting the results of the game. This analysis
        would help the team management, league administration to wisely chose the players and modify
        rules according to the impact of each decision. Data related some of the important factors 
        which plays major role in deciding the match winner are analysed. Their impact is predicted
        and compared with the actual results. Impact of these factors are studied for each individual
        team and individual season of this cricket tournament. Impact of each factor is plotted and its
        impact in next season is predicted.
