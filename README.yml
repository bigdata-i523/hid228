        Now-a-days, the process of storing the power measurements have changed. Conventional meters are replaced by the smart meters.
        New distribution management systems like SCADA and AMI are implemented to monitor power distribution. 
        These smart meters record the readings and communicate the data to the server. 
        However, these systems are designed to generate the readings very frequently i.e., 15 minutes to an hour. 
        Upon that, smart meters are being deployed at every possible location to improve the accuracy of the data.
        This advancements in electric power distribution system results in enormous amounts of data which requires advance analytics to process, analyse and store data. 
        This paper discusses about the implementation of Big Data technologies, challenges of implementing Big Data in Electric Power Distribution Systems.
