        Now-a-days, the process of storing the power measurements have
        changed. Conventional meters are replaced by the smart meters.
        New distribution management systems like SCADA and AMI are
        implemented to monitor power distribution.  These smart meters
        record the readings and communicate the data to the server.
        However, these systems are designed to generate the readings
        very frequently i.e., 15 minutes to an hour.  Upon that, smart
        meters are being deployed at every possible location to
        improve the accuracy of the data.  This advancements in
        electric power distribution system results in enormous amounts
        of data which requires advance analytics to process, analyse
        and store data.  This paper discusses about the implementation
        of Big Data technologies, challenges of implementing Big Data
        in Electric Power Distribution Systems.

        Data generated by aviation industry is being increased enormously. 
        The data generated by all the components of aviation industry can be
        analysed for reducing the operational costs, predict customer behaviour,
        analyse customer satisfaction. These applications of big data in aviation 
        industry makes it a prominent player. Hence, collecting this data,
        storing and processing them for desired results can help the aviation
        industry in boosting their profits and improve customer satisfaction.
        Various applications of Big data, their challenges and models are discussed here.
