4v's of bigdata

Volume
Energy readings from smart meters are increasing
Customers use this data to regulate their usage, plants use this data to regulate generation
This is picked up at high frequency
hence huge amount of data



variety
This data is very random

on generation side: 
various sources are used 
on dis side:
various technologies like SCADA is used.



Velocity:
This is picked up at high frequency
This is becoming huge day-by-day
As this data is very huge and random .we use big data technologies to store and process this data

veracity:

As electrical transmitting is open to environment.This data is full of noise


Driving motives:
1)Lower data storage and collection charges i.e., digital data storage costing less now a days
2)Widespread adoption of AMI 

Value Proposition:
Earlier it was not easy to collect and store data in a large scale may be excel but not quite feasible
Now, big data enabels them to  process data.

Applications: Theft detection:
1) There are two kind of  meters one at customer end and other at admin end ( concentrator meters)
2) Use previous available data to analyse the data diff b/w customer end and admin end

Generation at customer end: 
1) Customer now are installing self energy production system.
2) This actually injects energy back to system
3) We can study customer n=behaviour using this technology  with load averages as parameters

development of load forecasting:
As more meters are deployed at customer end, we can predict the load forecasting using the existing data

Difficulties:
1)Architecture design
2)Mathematical challenges
3)Data issues
	a) Data is incomplete
	b) Data from various systems. Each system has its own collection frequency
	c) data is heterogenous
	
Mathematical issues: 
Data is too huge,. Better algos like optimization algorithms ,Machile learning,mapreduce techniques must be used.
Algorithms must be used to granule data at their at the beginning and make it small to send the data. like map reduce system.

Data sources:
1)Customer data from meters
2)Data from Distribution systems
3)market data
4)weather and other miscelleanous

These are stored in HDFC or distributed file system.


risks:
1)Data privacy
2)failure of sensors lead to false raw data
