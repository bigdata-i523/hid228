4v's of bigdata

Volume
Energy readings from smart meters are increasing
Customers use this data to regulate their usage, plants use this data to regulate generation
This is picked up at high frequency
hence huge amount of data



variety
This data is very random

on generation side: 
various sources are used 
on dis side:
various technologies like SCADA is used.



Velocity:
This is picked up at high frequency
This is becoming huge day-by-day
As this data is very huge and random .we use big data technologies to store and process this data

veracity:

As electrical transmitting is open to environment.This data is full of noise
